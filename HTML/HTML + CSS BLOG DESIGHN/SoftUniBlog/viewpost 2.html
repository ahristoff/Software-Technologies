                        The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit (150,000,000 km), or AU.
                        For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km). Thus, the Sun
                        occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's
                        orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun.
                        Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun
                        and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune,
                        is 30 AU (4.5×109 km) from the Sun.
                        With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the
                        distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun.
                        For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury,
                        whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus.
                        Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances
                        (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images
                        at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of
                        the Solar System on different scales.
                        Some Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in
                        the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called
                        orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such
                        scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361-ft) Ericsson Globe
                        in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre
                        (25-foot) sphere at Arlanda International Airport, 40 km (25 mi) away, whereas
                        the farthest current object, Sedna, is a 10-cm (4-in) sphere in Luleå, 912 km (567 mi) away.
                        If the Sun–Neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about
                        3 cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant
                        planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm, and Earth's diameter along with that
                        of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3 mm) at this scale.
