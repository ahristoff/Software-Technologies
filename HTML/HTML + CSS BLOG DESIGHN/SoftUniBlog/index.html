                        The Solar System is the gravitationally-bound system comprising
                        the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
                        Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are
                        the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects,
                        such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects
                        that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest
                        planet, Mercury.
                        The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse
                        of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass
                        is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.
                        The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial
                        planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets
                        are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
                        The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly
                        of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune,
                        are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high
                        melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
                        water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits
                        that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

                        The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit (150,000,000 km), or AU.
                        For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km). Thus, the Sun
                        occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of
                        Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10−6) that of
                        the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km)
                        from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant
                        planet, Neptune, is 30 AU (4.5×109 km) from the Sun.
                        With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger
                        the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun.
                        For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury,
                        whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus.
                        Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances
                        (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images
                        at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of
                        the Solar System on different scales.
